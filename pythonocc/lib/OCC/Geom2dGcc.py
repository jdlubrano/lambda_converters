Tolerance is a tolerance criterion used by the algorithm to find a solution when, mathematically, the problem posed does not have a solution, but where there is numeric uncertainty attached to the arguments. For example, take two circles C1 and C2, such that C2 is inside C1, and almost tangential to C1. There is, in fact, no point of intersection between C1 and C2. You now want to find a circle of radius R (smaller than the radius of C2), which is tangential to C1 and C2, and inside these two circles: a pure mathematical resolution will not find a solution. This is where the tolerance criterion is used: the algorithm considers that C1 and C2 are tangential if the shortest distance between these two circles is less than or equal to Tolerance. Thus, a solution is found by the algorithm. Exceptions GccEnt_BadQualifier if a qualifier is inconsistent with the argument it qualifies (for example, enclosing for a line).
